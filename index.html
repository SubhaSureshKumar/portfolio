					<p>I started my career as a QA professional testing products used by millions, conducting UAT, root cause analysis, and functional testing across tech and insurance domains. That experience sharpened one skill above all: asking the right questions.</p>
					<p>Now I bring that same rigor to data. After a deliberate career pivot, I completed an E-Master's in Data Science & Business Analytics and built hands-on expertise in Tableau, Power BI, Alteryx, SQL, and Python. Today I don't just find gaps. I use data to close them.</p>
					<p>I currently volunteer as a data analyst for a non-profit, turning data into insights that drive real impact. I'm looking for analytics roles or returnship programs where my unique blend of QA precision and data storytelling adds immediate value.</p>

				<!-- Why I'm Different -->
				<article id="hr">
					<h2 class="major">Dear Recruiters & Hiring Managers</h2>
					<h3 class="subtitle">Why I'm Different?</h3>
					<p>Most analysts learn to ask questions about data. I learned to ask questions that prevent million-dollar mistakes. As a QA professional testing products for millions of users, I didn't just find bugs. I diagnosed why systems failed and what needed to change. That mindset of rigorous inquiry, root cause thinking, and user-first design now drives how I approach data.</p>
					<p>After deliberately pivoting to analytics, I built technical depth fast: E-Master's in Data Science & Business Analytics, plus hands-on proficiency in Tableau, Power BI, Alteryx, SQL, and Python. But my edge isn't just technical. It's knowing which questions unlock business value.</p>
					<p>Currently, I volunteer as a data analyst for a non-profit, translating messy datasets into actionable insights that drive measurable impact. I bring QA discipline to data quality, storytelling clarity to dashboards, and a proven ability to bridge technical work with business outcomes.</p>
					<h3>What I'm looking for?</h3> 
					<p>Analytics roles or returnship programs where precision meets strategy and where asking the right question matters as much as running the right query. Take a look at my <a href="#projects">work</a> to see my approach to data visualization, analysis, and storytelling in action.</p>
