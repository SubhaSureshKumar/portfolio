						<h3>Project Overview</h3>
						<p>
							This Excel project applies a structured <strong>Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)</strong> 
							framework to objectively rank 11 candidate vehicles for purchase. Rather than relying on subjective 
							preference, the analysis assigns weighted scores to each vehicle across several performance and value 
							dimensions, enabling a transparent, data-backed final recommendation.

						<h3>Methodology</h3>

						<div class="step">
							<h4>Step 1 — Raw Data Collection</h4>
							<p>
								Eleven vehicles were evaluated across nine attributes: Horsepower, Weight (lbs), Power-to-Weight 
								Ratio, MPG City, MPG Highway, Fuel Efficiency, Drive Type (AWD/FWD), Rear Legroom, Boot Space, 
								Safety Rating, and Total Price. All data was compiled into a structured raw data table to serve 
								as the foundation for further analysis.

						<div class="step">
							<h4>Step 2 — Data Normalization</h4>
							<p>
								To allow fair comparison across attributes with different units and scales, all numeric values 
								were normalized to a <strong>0–100 scale</strong> using min-max normalization. Each car's score 
								per attribute was expressed as a percentage of the maximum value observed in that category. For 
								Total Price, an <em>inverse normalization</em> was applied so that lower cost yields a higher 
								score — reflecting the buyer's preference for affordability.

						</div>

						<div class="step">
							<h4>Step 3 — Weighted Scoring &amp; Ranking</h4>
							<p>
								Four key attributes were selected for the final ranking, each assigned a weight based on buyer 
								priority: <strong>Power-to-Weight Ratio (30%)</strong>, <strong>Safety Rating (30%)</strong>, 
								<strong>Fuel Efficiency (20%)</strong>, and <strong>Rear Legroom (20%)</strong>. Each car's 
								weighted score was calculated by multiplying its normalized score in each category by the 
								corresponding weight, then summing the results. Vehicles were then ranked from highest to 
								lowest total score.

					<section class="results">
						<h4>Results</h4>
						<p>
							The <strong>Nissan Maxima</strong> emerged as the top-ranked vehicle (92.24), leading in 
							Power-to-Weight ratio. The <strong>Acura RLX</strong> placed 
							second (91.82), followed closely by the <strong>Honda Accord</strong> (91.60), which offered 
							the best all-round balance of efficiency, space, and safety.
						</p>

					<section class="conclusion">
						<h4>Conclusion</h4>
						<p>
							This project demonstrates how Excel can transform a complex personal decision into an objective, 
							repeatable process. By combining min-max normalization with a weighted scoring model, raw vehicle 
							data is converted into a clear ranked recommendation than going by intution or guessing. The framework is fully 
							adaptable: weights and criteria can be tuned to match any buyer's unique priorities.
